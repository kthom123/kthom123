### Hey, I'm Kyle ðŸ‘‹

I am a fullstack developer and a recent graduate of Le Wagon Tokyo.

I am entering the world of programming and enjoy making applications that can help make a difference in the lives of people. I have a particular interest in medicine and sports.

I also enjoy traveling and learning new things. I hope to continue learning and developing my skills.

Fun fact: I love snowboarding and used to do karate for several years âš¡

If you'd like to talk, reach out to me any time! ðŸ’¬
